I am a recent Computer Science graduate that has graduate from SUNY College at Old Westbury. I'm looking for my first entry level position in the software development field. I am open to backend or frontend development. My most important goal is to build upon my skillset and push further beyond any heights that I thought wasn't possible.

Right now I'm brushing up on my programming skills by refreshing concepts I already know and learning new ones through courses, articles, blogs and books. If I'm not doing that, I am on leetcode/hackerrank/firecode trying out DSA problems. I have a blog where I detail my learnings and other goals which I try to update weekly.

Outside of development, I enjoy competitive card games, learning the piano, biking and photography. I currently have a part time job as a sales associate where I develop my personal skills such as teamwork and time management.
